## General Information

This project was inspired by a tutorial done by Arslan on youtube, but design and details were created by myself. Information for the tutorials are found here:

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/arslanah99/Pokedex-Tutorial)
* [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNmn72kiZWU&t=224s)

## Optimizations

In this project, some optimizations that could be done include showcasing the page of pokemon that is being show, updating the button so that it is better placed and reducing the whitespace such as increasing the side of the photos in the detail page.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided me the opportunity to learn more about React and some of the more intimate details of it. It showed me how to do pagination, create a search function and link to other pages of the app as well as creating components that are linked to different parts of the app.

## Technologies

In addition to script written with JavaScript, React was used as the front-end framework. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilized [React-Router-Dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

The API used can be found [here](https://pokeapi.co/).
